### Overview

This program intakes a word, analyzes it, and gives back a response dependent upon a variety of conditionals. Unfortunately, its code isn't written according to best practice. Having everything in nested if... else statements is a good way to confuse yourself and other developers. Refactor this program and gain better understanding of block scope as you do.

### Objective

Refactor the Word-alyzer to be a better written program.

### Topics

A list of the concepts that this workshop will cover, in descending order of importance.

Example:

> - JavaScript
> - Functions
> - Arguments

### Context

Here is where you would cover the broader knowledge associated with the topics covered by the workshop. You could break down the syntax of specific methods, explain some under-the-hood functionality, and reiterate information necessary to success in the workshop. This should create a reference point for students if they felt they did not understand something during the workshop or are looking for more information that might provide a 'click' moment.

### Additional Resources

Link to any third-party resources that are related to the subject matter and would expand the students understanding beyond the scope of this workshop.
